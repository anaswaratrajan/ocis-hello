# Changelog

We are using [calens](https://github.com/restic/calens) to properly generate a
changelog before we are tagging a new release. To update the changelog copy the
files from the [unreleased](./unreleased) folder into a folder matching the
schema `0.1.0_2019-09-01` to tag and execute `calens` in the root folder of the
project.
